# ANA-515-Assignment-4

# Assignment 4 is our final data analytics project in the ANA 515 course. I used the Mall Customers dataset from Kaggle to perform hierarchical clustering and group the 200 customers into clusters based on their spending score and annual income.

# This was a fun project to do and the results are very insightful! They can be used in real life situations where businesses need to know their group of customers' behavior in order to send the right marketing messages and attract their target market. It is also an important measure to know what can keep your customers loyal.
